## Introduction

Projects in this class use Python 3.

Project 0 will cover the following:
- Instructions on how to set up Python,
- A mini-Python tutorial,

## Python Installation

You need a Python (3.6 or higher) distribution and either Pip or Conda.
- Install Python: For Windows and MacOS, use an official graphical installer to download and install Python 3.9. 
- For Linux, use a package manager.

- Install Pip: For Windows and MacOS, run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`. For Linux, use a package manager.

### Dependencies Installation

- Install numpy: `pip install numpy`
- Install matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
- We will need these for later but might as well install them now.


## Python Basics

If Python is new to you go through *https://developers.google.com/edu/python*

## For every problem, write a main function that tests your code with a few sample test cases.

## Q1: Basic String Manipulation

Write a Python function create_acronym that takes the name of a program, such as "Master of Science in Software Engineering", and returns its acronym ("MSSE"). Anything that's a capital letter.

## Q2: Basic Data Structures

Create a Python function add_course that takes a course name and its credits and adds it to a dictionary. The function should return the updated dictionary.  Review how dictionaries work in the tutorial.

## Q3: Control Structures and File I/O

Write a Python program to read a file containing a list of students and their grades for a particular course. Calculate the average grade. The file format is name,grade.

## Q4: Functions and Exception Handling

Implement a function enroll_student that takes a student's name and a course name to enroll in. Handle cases where the course is not offered or is already full. Raise appropriate exceptions for each case.

## Q5: Functions and Exception Handling

Write a Python function add_attraction that takes a list of tourist attractions in Minneapolis and adds a new attraction to it. The function should then return the updated list.

## Submission

Each problem should have a main function that tests your function.  Have a seperate file for each problem.
I will create a repo for each of you to submit to.
