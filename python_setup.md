## Introduction

Projects in this class use Python 3.

Project 0 will cover the following:
- Instructions on how to set up Python,
- Workflow examples,
- A mini-Python tutorial,
- Project grading: Every project’s release includes its autograder that you can run locally to debug. When you submit, the same autograder is run.

Files to Edit and Submit: You will fill in portions of `addition.py`, `buyLotsOfFruit.py`, and `shopSmart.py` during the assignment. Once you have completed the assignment, you will submit these files to Gradescope.

## Python Installation

You need a Python (3.6 or higher) distribution and either Pip or Conda. [...]
- Install Python: For Windows and MacOS, use an official graphical installer to download and install Python 3.9. For Linux, use a package manager.
- Install Pip: For Windows and MacOS, run `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`. For Linux, use a package manager.

### Dependencies Installation

First, go through the Autograding section to understand how to work with `tutorial.zip` and the `autograder.py` inside.
- Install numpy: `pip install numpy`
- Install matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`

#### Troubleshooting

Some installations may require using `python3` and `pip3`. [...]
If there is a `tkinter` import error, it’s likely because Python is atypical, and from Homebrew. [...]

## Workflow/Setup Examples

[...]

## Python Basics

If you’re new to Python or need a refresher, we recommend going through the Python basics tutorial.

## Autograding

[...]

## Q1: Addition

## Q3: shopSmart function

Fill in the function `shopSmart(orderList,fruitShops)` in `shopSmart.py`. [...]

## Submission

In order to submit your project upload the Python files you edited. For instance, use Gradescope’s upload on all `.py` files in the project folder.
